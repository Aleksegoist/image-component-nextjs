# Responsive Next JS Website with Image Component
###   In this App I use the internal routing system. This means for all of the images I use of lazy loading! I builded an image slider that lazy loads all the images which results in faster build times and increased SEO for my website. Since Next JS offers a built in routing system and the Link component this means I not have to use react-router-dom as we normally would when handling routing in React JS applications.
